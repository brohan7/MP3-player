## Setup 
To run the GUI you need to install git bash and follow the command to create a virtual environment so that it the GUI can run on that virtual environment 
 
<br> mkdir /e/mp3   ---> To make the directory and the directory is created in the file </br>
<br> cd /e/mp3   ---> To get inside the current directory </br>
<br> source  /virt/scripts/activate   ---> An virtual environment is created inside the directory </br>

So now you can run the python code inside the virtual environment 
** After that deactivate it to exit from the virtual environment
